# Task Manager App
## Node.js app enabling users to keep track of tasks

This app implements a REST API backend built with Node.js/Express which writes to a locally-hosted MongoDB database. 

Users can create accounts, modify their profile information (profile pic, etc.), and store and track tasks. Authentication is done via JSON Web Tokens and all endpoints are tested using the SuperTest module. 


This app was developed as part of Udemy's The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition).
